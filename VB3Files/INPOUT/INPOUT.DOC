InpOut.DLL
Copyright 1991 Jay Munro


InpOut.DLL is a complete INP and OUT replacement for Visual Basic written
in Assembler.  To use them, place the following declares in your
global or general module.

Declare Function Inp Lib "InpOut.DLL" (Byval Port%) As Integer
Declare Sub Out Lib "InpOut.DLL" (Byval Port%,Byval Value%)

Use just like their QuickBasic counterparts.
Out  Port%,Value ---- or  X% = Inp (Port%)

The complete .ASM source is contained in the InpOut.ASM file.
Response, .DEF, and BAT files are also provided to illustrate the building
of a .DLL.  The Windows SDK will be needed for the LIBW.LIB import library
and the RC compilier.  Masm 5.1 or better may be used to reassemble the file.

The Inp Procedure was used as an example in Jay Munro's Writting DLL's and
Controls in Assembly language at the August 1991 Microsoft Developers
Conference.

The Demo InpoutDM.MAK  may be loaded into VB.  When run and the button
is pressed, it makes a simple tone by toggling the speaker on and off.
